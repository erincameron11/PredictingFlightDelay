# PredictingFlightDelay

COSC3117 - Artificial Intelligence - Algoma University  
By: Erin Cameron



### Overview
The aim of this project is to use a publicly available dataset that describes worldwide Flight Status information from 2018-2021 to predict whether a flight is cancelled or not. The classification algorithms I chose for this project are: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes’ Classifier and Random Forest. All three models were implemented using Python’s scikit-learn machine learning library.

### Dataset
The dataset for this project can be found on the website Kaggle (` https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/flight-delay-dataset-20182022 `). Data files were not uploaded to this repository due to the large size of the files. A subsetted dataset which was used for model predictions can be found linked on Google Drive: ` https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wuc2VTNImHGBc6Z7_AY9Rlj1mRAS8jYu/view?usp=share_link `.
